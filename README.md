## ml-in-cosmology
This github attempts to maintain a comprehensive list of published machine learning applications to cosmology, organized by subject matter and arxiv posting date. Each entry contains the paper title, a simple summary of the machine learning methods used in the work, and the arxiv link. If I have missed any cosmology papers that you believe should be included please email me at gstein@berkeley.edu or issue a pull request.

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics, broadly working on problems in computational cosmology, but with a great interest in machine learning methods, and just made this for fun and to help anyone with similar interests. More info about me can be found at https://www.cita.utoronto.ca/~gstein/, and cheers to whoever can find which of the papers below have me as an author :beers:

## Large-Scale Structure


The [Large-Scale Structure](https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/March12/Coil/Coil1.html) of the universe is a field that relies on state-of-the art cosmological simulations to address a number of questions. Due to the computational complexity of these simulations, some investigations will remain computationally-infeasible for the forseeable future, and machine learning techniques can have a number of important uses.

## Reionization and 21cm
In cosmology, the process of [Reionization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reionization) refers to the period when our universe went from the "Dark Ages" before major star and galaxy formation, to the ionized state we see today.

## Gravitational Lensing
[Gravitational lensing](http://www.cfhtlens.org/public/what-gravitational-lensing) in cosmology refers to the bending of light due to mass between the source and Earth. This effect is very useful for inferring properties of the total mass distribution in our Universe, which is dominated by dark matter that we cannot see electromagnetically. Gravitational lensing comes in two types: weak and strong.

Strong gravitational lensing refers to the cases where the lensing effect (e.g. multiple images, clear shape distortions) is strong enough to be seen by the human eye, or equivalent, on an astronomical image. This only happens when a massive galaxy cluster lies between us and some background galaxies

Weak gravitational lensing refers to the global effect that almost all far away galaxies are gravitationally lensed by a small amount, which changes their observed shape by roughly 1%. This can only be measured statistically when given a large number of samples, and not on an object-to-object basis.

## Cosmic Microwave Background
The [Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background) is the light left over from the period of recombination in the very early Universe, 380,000 years after the beginning. CMB observations are sometimes referred to as "baby pictures of our Universe", as this light has been travelling for 13.5 billion years just to reach us.

## Parameter Estimation
Cosmological parameter estimation is the mechanism of inferring the contents and evolution of our universe from observations. This topic is quite broad, and therefore parameter estimation papers with a focus on an individual experiment/dataset can be found in other sections (e.g. the Reionization and 21cm section). Note this section is unfinished
